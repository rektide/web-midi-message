> Configure Korg Nanokontrol2 via web-midi

The Korg NanoKontrol2 is a low cost MIDI mixing device, setup via a large blob of configuration that is setup and talked to via some special System Exclusive MIDI commands.

This library provides utilities to dump and load configuration, as well as classes to represent the Scene blobs.
